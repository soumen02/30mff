# Quit. - A Story of Addiction
### 30 Minute Film Festival

Welcome the first website I have made - using HTML, CSS and javascript. 

The website is a landing page for the 30 Minute Film Festival Project, which shares a story of addiction. It is one page with disappearing elements to give the effect of a presentation that is at the control of the user. The pages change with a click on the screen, and cycle back to the start after the last screen. 

## Process

I started off creating a simple page that matched my wireframe/mockup. Then, I created the javascript page to add a trasition from that page to the next and replicated this three more times to create the keywords for my video. Next, I was able to nest the video in its place and keep it hidden till the user reached the last keyword. 

After the video finishes playing, another click takes the user to the Makers page. Here, two images are displayed - placeholder images that are meant to be labelled images of me and Armaan. 

A final click restarts this story.

## Reflections - Challenges and Future Improvements 

As a whole, I'm _not_ satisfied with the website. But, I'm proud I could get here from scratch. Being my first class is front-end development, I'm not surprised that I couldnt bring the exact idea I had in mind into reality. 

I would faced the following challenges and have a basic idea on how I could bring the idea I have in mind to life. 

Overcoming issues in **CSS** was a major challenge. I had a hard time placing the content in the right layout. Though I'm glad I could learn how the various elements in CSS fit together. I was also unable to animate the scrolling / fade-in and out of the different slide pages. 

Another issue I faced was using <divs>, ids and classes properly in HTML so I could control the interactivity of the page. With a little more practice I should be able to overcome this challenge. 

The website was extremely buggy and I was able to get rid of most of them, but a few still remain. If the user clicks on the place the video appears, they are able to play the video even before it shows. Fixing this should fix the functional bugs on the website. Next, I would resize and frame the makers images to match my initial idea on the mockup.
